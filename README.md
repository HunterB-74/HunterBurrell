## About Me

Hi my name is Hunter Burrell, I am currently 19 years old and a freshman student at the University of Missouri.
I really enjoy technology all around, but if I had to pick a favorite topic it would be networking.
The biggest things I've learned when it comes to technology is to keep an open mind, and that sometimes the simplest solution is the one that works the best.<br>
By following the links below you can learn some more about me.
