# Where I am from.

I was originally born in Illinois, but when I was still really young my family moved around alot due to my moms work.
So far I have lived in Illinois and Missouri twice, and once in Tennessee.
The first time I lived in Missouri it was in a small town in the southern portion of the state called Scopus.<br>

Just to show how small of a town it is here is a link to the [wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus,_Missouri)<br>

Before we moved to Scopus was when we lived in Tennessee, I was still very young at taht point and the only thing I can really remember from living there was when a tornado came near the house.
Eventually though we moved from Scopus back to Illinois into the town of Moweaqua.
We lived there for eight years untill we moved to Missouri again.<br>

Moweaqua was up untill now that longest I had lived in one place, and a made alot of longtime friends there that I still talk to.
The town itself also has a bit of history behind it involving the old coal mine.
If you want to know more about that you can go [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moweaqua,_Illinois)<br>

That pretty well sums up the interesting places I've lived.
